Matrix operations using 2D arrays in C

This is my first 200+ lines code project in C.

The program I Developed is a C program for matrix operations, focusing on multiplication and transposition.

Implementation: Established a robust foundation for matrix handling, including user input validation and dynamic memory allocation.

Key Achievements:
Successfully implemented matrix transposition, swapping rows and columns.
Overcame challenges in matrix multiplication, ensuring correct dimensions for accurate results.

I have also made sure to account for error checking, making sure every step of the way,
there is a prompt to ask the user if his/her input was correct or not and if not, loops back to re-enter the matrix.
